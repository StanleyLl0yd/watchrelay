# Mandatory Repository-Wide Audit and Deep-Refactoring Protocol

When a task requests a full audit, cleanup, optimization, simplification, or deep refactoring, the rules in this document are mandatory.

A repository-wide audit is an implementation task, not merely a request for recommendations.

## Objective

Audit the entire repository and reduce the codebase to the minimum necessary complexity while preserving 100% of its current functionality and externally observable behavior.

The refactored project must preserve, unless an explicitly requested bug fix requires otherwise:

- user-facing functionality;
- application behavior;
- UI/UX;
- business or game logic;
- public APIs and contracts;
- persisted and exchanged data formats;
- platform-specific behavior;
- documented capabilities;
- edge-case semantics.

The goal is minimum **necessary complexity**, not minimum line count.

Do not perform code golf.

A change is justified only when it objectively reduces one or more of:

- code volume;
- duplication;
- conceptual complexity;
- branching or state;
- coupling;
- maintenance burden;
- dependency surface;
- runtime cost;
- regression risk.

If a change merely makes the implementation different without making it demonstrably smaller, simpler, safer, clearer, or more efficient, leave the code unchanged.

Default decision rule:

- if code is proven unnecessary, delete it;
- if code can be objectively simplified, simplify it;
- if duplicate responsibilities can be safely consolidated, consolidate them;
- if an abstraction no longer provides value, remove it;
- if the benefit is uncertain, preserve the existing working behavior.

## Required audit scope

Before making repository-wide refactoring changes, inspect the complete repository rather than only recently changed files or obvious hotspots.

Review all relevant areas, including:

- production source code;
- tests and test utilities;
- resources and assets;
- configuration files;
- build scripts and build configuration;
- CI/CD workflows;
- release tooling;
- dependencies and development dependencies;
- static-analysis and security configuration;
- documentation;
- platform-specific integration;
- generated-code integration points;
- directory and module structure.

First establish:

1. the actual architecture;
2. authoritative sources of state and business logic;
3. all current user-visible functionality;
4. important internal behavior and contracts;
5. persistence and compatibility requirements;
6. framework-, build-, platform-, or convention-driven entry points.

Only then begin removing or consolidating code.

## Required removal candidates

Actively search for and remove, when proven safe:

- dead code;
- unreachable code;
- unused functions;
- unused classes;
- unused methods;
- unused variables;
- unused constants;
- unused types;
- unused interfaces;
- unused imports and exports;
- unused files;
- unused resources and assets;
- obsolete legacy code that no longer participates in current behavior;
- temporary workarounds whose original constraint no longer exists;
- duplicate or near-duplicate implementations;
- unnecessary abstraction layers;
- unnecessary wrappers;
- unnecessary helper functions;
- adapter chains that add no meaningful semantics;
- redundant data conversions;
- redundant intermediate objects;
- redundant intermediate state;
- redundant copies and transformations;
- defensive checks for states already guaranteed by types, architecture, invariants, or earlier validation;
- repeated validation of already validated data;
- repeated checks of the same condition;
- redundant fallbacks;
- obsolete compatibility branches;
- unused feature flags;
- obsolete configuration options;
- unused dependencies;
- unused development dependencies;
- duplicate-purpose dependencies;
- commented-out historical code;
- stale TODO/FIXME items;
- leftovers from previous migrations or refactors.

Pay particular attention to patterns such as:

- repeated null/state/bounds checks;
- nested checks of the same condition;
- repeated validation across adjacent layers;
- unnecessary `try/catch` blocks;
- wrapper -> wrapper -> wrapper call chains;
- DTO/model conversion chains;
- multiple representations of the same authoritative state;
- temporary states that duplicate existing state;
- compatibility paths left behind after migrations;
- helpers with only one trivial caller;
- abstractions created for future scenarios that never materialized.

## Proving code is unused

Do not classify code as unused solely because a textual search finds no direct call.

Before removing anything, check for indirect or convention-driven use through:

- callbacks;
- events;
- observers;
- dependency injection;
- reflection;
- dynamic loading;
- serialization/deserialization;
- framework conventions;
- lifecycle hooks;
- manifests;
- resources;
- routing;
- configuration;
- generated code;
- build scripts;
- CI/CD;
- release tooling;
- plugins;
- native/platform integration;
- test or debug tooling;
- external/public contracts.

When uncertainty remains, preserve the code until its lack of use can be demonstrated.

## Required simplification review

Look for opportunities to safely:

- shorten code without reducing readability;
- simplify control flow;
- reduce nesting;
- reduce mutable state;
- reduce the number of branches;
- merge equivalent paths;
- merge components with the same responsibility;
- remove unnecessary temporary values;
- remove unnecessary objects and allocations;
- remove redundant copies;
- remove repeated transformations;
- remove redundant loops or passes over the same data;
- compute invariant values once instead of repeatedly;
- replace custom code with standard language, platform, framework, or library facilities when clearly simpler;
- eliminate repeated business logic;
- centralize genuinely shared logic when doing so reduces total code and conceptual complexity;
- reduce coupling;
- remove premature generalization;
- remove architecture that exists only for hypothetical future requirements.

Do not introduce an abstraction merely to satisfy DRY.

Similar-looking code should only be unified when the resulting abstraction reduces real duplication and overall complexity.

## Architecture review

Explicitly determine whether:

- historical layers are still necessary;
- historical components are still necessary;
- abstractions are disproportionate to the actual problem;
- interfaces exist with only one implementation and no meaningful boundary benefit;
- classes or modules can be safely merged;
- classes or modules can be safely deleted;
- responsibilities are unnecessarily fragmented;
- there is premature generalization;
- there is speculative extensibility;
- infrastructure exists only for hypothetical future features;
- current architecture reflects requirements that no longer exist;
- duplicated state or business logic creates unnecessary coupling;
- implementation complexity is proportional to actual product complexity.

Prefer the simplest architecture that fully supports the current product.

Do not perform a large rewrite merely because another architecture appears cleaner, newer, or more fashionable.

## Performance review

Review performance only where there is practical value.

Look for:

- repeated calculations;
- repeated queries;
- repeated reads;
- unnecessary parsing;
- repeated transformations of unchanged data;
- avoidable allocations;
- unnecessary copies;
- redundant loops;
- multiple passes that can safely become one;
- unnecessary render/re-render/rebuild/recompute work;
- inappropriate data structures for actual access patterns;
- invariant operations performed repeatedly instead of once;
- unnecessary work in frequently executed paths.

Do not introduce micro-optimizations that reduce readability or maintainability without an obvious or measurable benefit.

## Dependency review

Review every production and development dependency.

For each dependency:

- verify that it is actually used;
- verify that its purpose is still required;
- remove unused dependencies;
- remove obsolete dependencies;
- identify multiple libraries serving the same purpose;
- consolidate overlapping dependencies where safe;
- prefer standard language/platform/framework functionality when it clearly replaces a dependency with less total complexity.

A dependency may be replaced by a small local implementation only when doing so clearly reduces overall complexity, risk, maintenance cost, or artifact size.

Do not replace a mature, well-maintained library with custom code merely to reduce the dependency count.

## Non-negotiable behavior-preservation rules

Unless explicitly requested, a repository-wide cleanup or refactor must not intentionally:

- remove user-facing functionality;
- change existing UX;
- change visual behavior;
- change business logic;
- change game rules;
- change public APIs;
- change public contracts;
- change persisted data formats;
- change exchanged data formats;
- change edge-case behavior;
- change platform behavior;
- weaken compatibility;
- weaken accessibility;
- weaken security or privacy controls;
- reduce functionality merely to reduce code size;
- add unrelated functionality;
- introduce new architectural layers only to satisfy generic best practices;
- perform a broad rewrite without a demonstrated need.

Repository-specific invariants defined in the root `AGENTS.md` remain mandatory throughout the refactor.

## Required execution workflow

For a repository-wide audit or deep refactor:

1. Inspect the entire repository.
2. Establish the current:
   - architecture;
   - feature set;
   - user-visible behavior;
   - internal contracts;
   - authoritative state;
   - persistence behavior;
   - platform constraints.
3. Collect reliable baseline statistics where practical.
4. Build an internal candidate list grouped into:
   - deletion;
   - consolidation;
   - simplification;
   - architecture reduction;
   - dependency cleanup;
   - practical performance optimization.
5. Validate every removal against both direct and indirect usage.
6. Rank candidates by:
   - confidence;
   - regression risk;
   - complexity reduction;
   - maintenance benefit.
7. Apply changes in small, logically coherent groups rather than as one uncontrolled rewrite.
8. After every meaningful group, run the relevant available checks, such as:
   - unit tests;
   - integration tests;
   - regression tests;
   - lint;
   - formatting checks;
   - type checking;
   - compilation;
   - build;
   - static analysis;
   - dependency/security checks;
   - project-specific validation.
9. If critical behavior lacks sufficient test coverage for a contemplated risky change, first add the minimum regression test required to capture the existing behavior.
10. Keep behavior-preserving refactoring separate from unrelated feature development.
11. When a candidate cannot be proven safe, leave it unchanged and record the reason.
12. Complete the first refactoring pass.
13. Perform a mandatory second full pass over the already-refactored repository.
14. During the second pass, look again for:
   - newly exposed simplification opportunities;
   - remaining dead code;
   - residual duplication;
   - unnecessary abstractions;
   - unnecessary wrappers;
   - redundant checks;
   - unused dependencies;
   - residual legacy;
   - temporary structures made obsolete by the first pass.
15. Finish with the complete available project verification suite.

## Validation requirements

The final verification should include every applicable repository check.

Examples include:

- clean build;
- complete unit-test suite;
- integration tests;
- regression tests;
- lint;
- formatting verification;
- type checking;
- static analysis;
- dependency audit;
- security checks;
- platform-specific builds;
- production build;
- project-specific verification scripts.

Do not claim a check passed unless it was actually executed successfully.

If a check cannot be run because of environment, credentials, hardware, platform, unavailable tooling, or another external limitation, state that explicitly.

## Comments during refactoring

Preserve the repository's comment policy.

As a default:

- keep comments to the minimum necessary;
- keep source-code comments in English;
- remove stale comments;
- remove misleading comments;
- remove redundant comments;
- do not add comments that merely narrate obvious code;
- retain comments that explain a non-obvious reason, constraint, workaround, invariant, compatibility requirement, or important contract.

Do not replace clear code with explanatory comments when the code itself can be made self-explanatory.

## Completion standard

A repository-wide audit/refactoring task is not complete merely because:

- code was formatted;
- static analysis was run;
- recommendations were listed;
- potential improvements were described;
- only recently modified files were reviewed.

Safe and justified improvements must be implemented directly.

The final codebase should be objectively smaller, simpler, less duplicated, less coupled, easier to reason about, or easier to maintain while preserving behavior.

## Required final report

At completion, report:

1. **Removed**
   - dead code;
   - unused files/resources;
   - obsolete compatibility code;
   - unnecessary abstractions;
   - other removed components.
2. **Consolidated**
   - duplicated logic;
   - equivalent components;
   - repeated validation;
   - shared responsibilities.
3. **Simplified**
   - control flow;
   - state;
   - architecture;
   - transformations;
   - hot paths.
4. **Dependencies**
   - dependencies removed;
   - duplicate-purpose dependencies consolidated;
   - dependency changes intentionally not made and why.
5. **Legacy**
   - legacy components found;
   - which were removed;
   - which remain and why.
6. **Intentionally unchanged**
   - candidates reviewed but preserved;
   - reason removal or simplification could not be proven safe.
7. **Verification**
   - tests run;
   - builds run;
   - lint/typecheck/static-analysis/security checks run;
   - their results.
8. **Limitations**
   - areas that could not be safely optimized;
   - missing coverage;
   - unavailable environment/tooling;
   - external constraints.
9. **Before/after statistics**, when they can be measured reliably:
   - file count;
   - source line count;
   - dependency count;
   - test count;
   - production/build artifact size;
   - other project-relevant metrics.

Never invent statistics.

Use the same counting method for before and after values.

## Final principle

When choosing between:

- preserving working code whose necessity is uncertain;
- deleting code because it appears unnecessary;

preserve the working behavior until the code is proven unnecessary.

The final goal is a codebase containing only the complexity required to implement the project's current functionality: as small, clean, understandable, maintainable, and efficient as reasonably possible, without functional regressions.
